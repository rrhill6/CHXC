        <h4>Asics - Bob Blastow Early Bird</h4>
        <p>Highlight from the second meet of the season... the athletes are quickly showing some improvement! The girls' squad put up a 4th place team score against some pretty talented teams. The boys narrowly (by 1 point!) missed a top 5 team finish to last year's Region champion Sandy Creek team. The gap has narrowed and should make for a great region competition on the boys side this year! <a href="http://ga.milesplit.com/meets/280712/results#.WasznK2ZO9Y" target="_blank">Click here to see complete meet results.</a></p>
        <h4>Zach Wansley Cross Country Clash</h4>
